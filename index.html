                      <p>With a decent number of summer destinations in India, picking a favorite summer tour package is surely a confusing task. During the summer months, the cities placed on the northern plains, such as Jaipur, Agra, Delhi, etc., face the scorching heat and vacation up towards the north and northeast to places like Kashmir, Leh, Ooty, and Ranikhet becomes almost necessary. However, for exploring and experiencing the splendor of the hill stations of India, summer is the best time.</p>
                      <p>The Himalayan region of India is flocked by tourists from all around as it has to offer a plethora of activities and attractions such as high-altitude mountain passes, several trekking routes, lush surroundings, tranquil ambiance, and pleasant climate, azure lakes, a sneak peak into Tibetan Buddhism and even more.</p>
                      <hr />
                      <p>Summer vacation in India is a lot of fun with a whole lot of activities in which one can indulge. You can take a stroll at the serene beaches of Goa, Kerala, or Andamans. Planning a trip to ‘Heaven on Earth’- Kashmir or partaking in adventure activities in Leh would also be a great idea. Whitewater rafting in Rishikesh is a wonderful option too.</p>
                      <p>For a peaceful and relaxing trip, we have summer holiday packages in India, for instance, Kodaikanal and Munnar. Avail the benefits of authentic Ayurveda massages in any popular Ayurveda and Spa resort in Kovalam. Smell the aroma of tea and coffee in Darjeeling and explore India's cultural diversity.</p>
